### Data-free knowledge distillation
+ Designed a new loss function for the generator to produce samples with high authenticity, class diversity,
and inter-sample diversity to facilitate data-free knowledge distillation with higher accuracy and more
robustness over different hyperparameter settings

_Collaborated with Jihong Park (Deakin University, Australia) and Shiqiang Wang (IBM T.J. Watson Research
Center, USA)_

### Service placement in mobile edge cloud networks
+ Formulated the interference in terms of delay among services coexisting on the same infrastructure and 
designed algorithms to minimize overall resource cost for multi-component service placement to achieve 
interference awareness and delay guarantee

+ Defined the equivalent bandwidth for the resource allocation of an edge in a service and designed methods
for joint optimization of small cell zooming and multi-component service placement with reduced resource
fragments and guaranteed QoS aiming at power consumption minimization

### Communication-efficient federated learning
+ Automatically determined the degree the sparsity of gradient sparsification enabled federated learning with
non-i.i.d. local datasets to minimize the overall training time

_Collaborated with Shiqiang Wang (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, USA) and Kin K Leung (Imperial College
London, UK)_

### Capacity of distributed computing systems
+ Derived theoretical formulas for the capacity of distributed systems with multiple resource types, where the
power of d choices is considered as the task scheduling strategy in the analysis

_Collaborated with Kin K Leung (Imperial College London, UK) and Shiqiang Wang (IBM T.J. Watson Research
Center, USA)_

### Resource allocation in converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks
+ Focused on improving the physical resource utilization in Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) applications.Adjusted the QoS satisfaction of virtual networks to achieve best-effort service and increase the revenue of
infrastructure provider
+ Proposed energy-saving VNE schemes for 5G enhanced FiWi access networks with scalable cells
+ Proposed algorithms for controlling the power states of network devices for energy-efficient network design
